MongoDB uses indexes to optimize query performance, and in some cases, certain `$` operators can leverage these indexes efficiently. Here are some examples of how various `$` operators can use indexes:

1. **Equality Queries with `$eq`:**
   - The `$eq` operator is used for equality comparisons.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     db.collection.find({ field: { $eq: value } })
     ```

   - If there is an index on the `field` being queried with `$eq`, MongoDB can efficiently use the index to find the matching document(s).

2. **Range Queries with `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`:**
   - Range queries can benefit from indexes, especially for fields with high cardinality.
   - Examples:

     ```javascript
     // Greater than
     db.collection.find({ field: { $gt: value } })

     // Less than or equal to
     db.collection.find({ field: { $lte: value } })
     ```

   - If there is an index on the queried field, MongoDB can use the index to quickly identify the range of documents.

3. **Queries with `$in`:**
   - The `$in` operator is used to match any of the values specified in an array.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [value1, value2, value3] } })
     ```

   - If there is an index on the `field`, MongoDB can use it to efficiently find documents with any of the specified values.

4. **Array Queries with `$elemMatch`:**
   - The `$elemMatch` operator is used to query elements within arrays.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     db.collection.find({ arrayField: { $elemMatch: { nestedField: value } } })
     ```

   - If there is an index on `arrayField.nestedField`, MongoDB can use it for efficient queries.

5. **Text Search with `$text`:**
   - The `$text` operator is used for full-text search.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     db.collection.find({ $text: { $search: "searchTerm" } })
     ```

   - If there is a text index on the specified fields, MongoDB can use it to perform efficient text searches.

6. **Queries with `$exists`:**
   - The `$exists` operator is used to match documents where a field exists or does not exist.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     db.collection.find({ field: { $exists: true } })
     ```

   - If there is an index on the `field`, MongoDB can use it to efficiently find documents where the field exists.

7. **Update Operations:**
   - The use of `$` operators in update operations can also impact index usage. For example:
     ```javascript
     db.collection.update({ field: value }, { $set: { updatedField: newValue } })
     ```
     - The index on `field` can be utilized for the query part, but the update operation might not benefit from an index depending on the update.

When designing queries, it's essential to consider the types of operations and the use of `$` operators in those queries. Analyzing the query execution plan (`explain()` method) can provide insights into how indexes are being used by MongoDB for a specific query. Additionally, the choice of indexes and their order in compound indexes can influence query performance.
