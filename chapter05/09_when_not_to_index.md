While indexes can significantly improve query performance, there are situations where adding indexes might not be beneficial, or even counterproductive. Here are some scenarios when you might consider not adding indexes:

1. **Small Collections:**
   - For very small collections that easily fit into memory, the overhead of maintaining indexes may outweigh the performance gain from using them. If a collection is small and doesn't experience frequent queries, MongoDB might perform well without additional indexes.

2. **Write-Intensive Workloads:**
   - In scenarios where write operations significantly outnumber read operations, the overhead of maintaining indexes during writes may impact overall system performance. Each insert, update, or delete operation on a document with indexes requires additional work to update the indexes.

3. **Frequent Updates of Indexed Fields:**
   - If you have fields that are frequently updated, especially with values that are indexed, MongoDB has to update the indexes every time a document is modified. This can impact performance, and in some cases, it might be more efficient to reevaluate the necessity of the index.

4. **Low Cardinality Fields:**
   - Indexes on fields with low cardinality (few unique values) might not significantly improve query performance. If a field has only a few distinct values, the index may not be selective enough, and a full collection scan might be more efficient.

5. **Queries with No Selectivity:**
   - If a query selects a large portion of the data (low selectivity), using an index might not be effective. In such cases, MongoDB may choose to perform a collection scan instead of using the index.

6. **Indexes on Frequently Modified Fields:**
   - Adding indexes on fields that are frequently modified can result in a higher rate of index rebuilding and may impact overall system performance.

7. **Resource Constraints:**
   - In resource-constrained environments, such as environments with limited memory or disk space, the additional storage and memory requirements for indexes may not be feasible.

8. **Ad Hoc Queries:**
   - If your application performs a lot of ad hoc queries that are difficult to predict, creating indexes for each possible query might not be practical. In such cases, a more flexible indexing strategy might be needed.

It's essential to carefully analyze your application's workload, profile query patterns, and monitor system performance before deciding to add or remove indexes. Regularly review and optimize indexes based on the changing needs of your application.
